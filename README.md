- Google doc contains the connection string, you just need to request access 
- right click on prof file. User Secrets, paste the doc contents into thre secrets.json file

We used mySQL for the database
We used the extension .NET to run
Use the command 'dotnet run' to run the program 
CTRL + Click the link to see the page in whichever browser
The page opens with the home page, you can click through each tab to see each the other pages 
The navigation bar at the top contains the hyperlinks for each page, also the icon will bring you back to the home page
Newsletter: You can type in email and name and it will redirect to a confirmation page
Newsletter API: attempts have been made as seen in Newsletter.razor but it is not functioning
Login: To test functionality the email you can enter is "gking16@lsu.edu" and password is "passTest" 
Sign Up: Front end is set up but it doesn't save information 
Forgot password link will bring you to a redirect page (not working)
Shop: Is fleshed out except for the cart/checkout
The Lounge: the front end it done for the lounge and there is a place for the user to make posts, but its not connected to the backend so it currently doesn't save the posts
Campaign Manager: The front end is done but it has no functionality
Footer: 'Contact Us,' 'Privacy Policy,' and 'Terms of Service' just lead to counter pages because they aren't made


We tried our hardest to get the front end and back end connected but we were stripped for time and the limits of what we knew how to do, so our website can read from the database but cannot do any writing to it.
